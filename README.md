I really enjoyed working the task. In my current job I am working mostly on logical and bussines side of the application and it was really refreshing to work on this app where there is much more styling involved. I approached the project using React with Typescript together with styled-componenets. I divided application in many smaller components and sections.

I didn't finish the application fully (mostly responsiveness) because I'm already working full-time job. But I tried my best finishing out the project.
Some of the things I would do if I had more time are, make the components and styling more reusable, optimize images and code, structure the code so it is more cleaner, finish out responsiveness and found out different ways of how to approach layouts on the project.

I would also test the app using react-testing-library and store the static data on the cloud for example (firebase)
